# Research Notes

This document contains notes and reflections on the research process for the badge platform development.

## Provisional Research Goals
- Investigate user engagement with digital badges in an educational technology setting.
- Explore how participatory design affects user motivation and interaction.
- Analyze interaction data (clicks, time spent, navigation patterns, comments/reactions).
- Study self-monitoring behaviors in learning environments.

## Notes and Key Findings
- **[31/03/2025]** Transitioned from WhatsApp to Telegram for bot notifications due to WhatsApp's limitations in group message automation. Telegram provides native bot functionalities that align better with the project's goals.
- **[31/03/2025]** Implemented a security question-based authentication system instead of traditional login methods to simplify user access.
- **[31/03/2025]** Designed a minimalist UI with collapsible sections to improve usability and maintain focus on badge progress.
- **[31/03/2025]** Decided on self-claimable badges without approval to enhance engagement and autonomy.
